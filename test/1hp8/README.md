# README 1HP8

For ab-initio calculations we want to be working on small molecules.
The paper by Cheek et al.[^Cheek_2006] suggested this protein as
one that has small domains with disulfide bonds.

* 1hp8.pdb - The original structure as obtained from the protein
  data bank

* 1hp8_1.pdb - The first set residues with a disulfide bond

* 1hp8_2.pdb - The second set of residues with a disulfide bond

* 1hp8_1_h.pdb - Same as 1hp8_1 but with hydrogens added with HAAD [^Li_2009]

* 1hp8_2_h.pdb - Same as 1hp8_2 but with hydrogens added with HAAD [^Li_2009]
